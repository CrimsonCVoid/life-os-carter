## State (2026-05-22)

- **Branch:** `native` at `dcf339b`
- **Working tree:** clean
- **Pushed to:** origin/native, carter/native, life-os-dev/native, carter/main — all at `dcf339b`

---

## Big infrastructure pivot this session

The live Neon database the old Capacitor app pointed at had drifted materially from
`src/lib/db/schema.ts`. Every new `/api/data/*` call from the native app surfaced a different
column-missing or constraint-mismatch error (`name`, `archived_at`, `photo_indexeddb_key`,
`exercises`, etc.). After a few cycles of whack-a-mole patching, we **created a fresh Neon project
and pushed schema.ts cleanly**:

- New Neon project endpoint: `ep-billowing-thunder-apmp5h9d.c-7.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech`
- 48 tables created via `npm run db:push` — matches `schema.ts` exactly
- Old Neon project is dead — do not point at it
- **Vercel env vars `DATABASE_URL` + `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` must be set to the new project**
  before any /api/* call works

The data-layer functions (`createMeal`, `createHabit`, `createLiftSession`) still use raw SQL
bypasses written during the drift period — they work against either schema. Once the new DB is
fully wired and stable, those can be reverted to clean Drizzle as a follow-up.

---

## Architecture decisions made this session

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| **No CloudKit, stay on Vercel+Neon** | iOS-only target now, but keeping one DB makes future surfaces (web mirror, multi-device read) cheaper. |
| **Hybrid auth: device-bound default + optional Apple/Google link** | SIWA provisioning was blocking app launch entirely. App now opens with zero friction; Settings has opt-in "Link Apple ID" / "Link Google" that migrates existing data to an identity-bound user. |
| **JWT subject = prefixed external ID; DB id = hashed UUID** | Live `users.id` was uuid-typed; prefixed strings like `device:<uuid>` 22P02'd. SHA-1-hash the prefixed string into a deterministic UUID at the SQL boundary. iOS keeps the prefix via `AuthStore.identityProvider`. |
| **Middleware allows bearer-token /api/* through** | Was 307'ing every iOS API call to /signin → surfaced as "Failed to find Server Action" client-side. Cookie-gate now only applies to non-bearer requests on page routes. |
| **Two Live Activities with relevanceScore stacking** | One card couldn't fit all the elements. iOS doesn't let us prevent LA stacking; we use relevanceScore (Controls=100, Info=50) so the system places Controls on top. Each card has a peek-strip designed for the back-of-stack case. |
| **Branding scrub: no "Gemini" or "OpenFoodFacts" in UI** | Generic "AI estimate" / "Pulled from the label". Backend route comments still mention providers — not user-visible. |

---

## What works end-to-end

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| App launches with zero friction | ✅ | Device UUID → JWT auto-mints on first launch via `/api/auth/device-mint` |
| Settings → Link Apple ID | 🟡 | Backend works (`/api/auth/link-identity` 200s); client-side blocked by SIWA capability on dev account until provisioning is sorted |
| Settings → Link Google | 🟡 | iOS OAuth client ID lives in `project.yml`; `GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` env var must be set on Vercel for audience-check to pass |
| Workout flow (start → log sets → finish) | ✅ | Drop sets indented + chipped, swipe-to-delete (custom drag in `SetRow.swift` since `.swipeActions` doesn't work outside a List), superset menu, plate calc, RPE drawer |
| Per-session detail screen with charts | ✅ | Tap any row in Gym → Recent sessions |
| Live Activity (Info + Controls cards) | ✅ | Controls on top, info peeks, parallel `Activity.update` for ~halved latency, 50ms pulse-clear tick |
| Lock-screen tap → haptic + button pulse | ✅ | Haptic fires inside intent (main app process), pulse via `lastAction` + `lastActionAt` in `WorkoutContentState` |
| Nutrition: barcode (camera) | ✅ | VisionKit DataScanner → OpenFoodFacts → servings stepper review sheet (macros read-only) |
| Nutrition: photo (camera OR library) | ✅ | UIImagePickerController for camera + PhotosPicker for library |
| Nutrition: voice (hold-to-record) | ✅ | AVAudioRecorder → `/api/voice-meal` |
| Meal edit + delete | ✅ | Tap row → edit sheet, long-press → context menu |
| Analysis tab → Overseer coach chat | ✅ | Streams from `/api/overseer`, no provider named in UI |
| SyncService → Neon | ✅ | lift_sessions, habits, journal_entries, meals (raw-SQL data-layer) |
| Mock data seeder (Settings → Test Data) | ✅ | Throwaway. Populate generates 30d of realistic data, Wipe nukes the local SwiftData store |
| Delete PRs (long-press on PR row) | ✅ | Context menu in GymView |

---

## What's still placeholder / unwired

- **HealthKit reads on Today + Analysis** — manager has `fetchSum`/`fetchAverage` but every screen uses `Sample.*` static values
- **Body screen** — not built
- **Push notifications (APNs)** — entitlement set, no device-token registration code
- **Day-entry direct-input flows** — water/sleep/mood/weight/steps logs have Neon routes but no iOS UI writes to them yet
- **TestFlight** — `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` set to `6A3B3XQF6G` (wcarterbrady@icloud.com) in `project.yml`. Still needs an App Store Connect app record + first archive upload before TestFlight invites can go out

---

## Vercel env vars

Set on **Production / Preview / Development**, then **Deployments → latest → Redeploy**:

| Env var | Required? | What breaks without it |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | YES | Every `/api/*` 500 |
| `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` | YES (for `db:push`) | drizzle-kit DDL ops |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | YES (32+ char random, `openssl rand -base64 32`) | Every bearer JWT 401 |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | YES | Voice/photo/Coach all 500 |
| `GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` | YES (`778767465909-49jj6q2nd2gcn4qocvnlmgvbv8lhknuk.apps.googleusercontent.com`) | Link Google in Settings 401s |
| `CRON_SECRET`, `VAPID_*`, `AUTH_GOOGLE_*`, `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` | Optional | Legacy/web features only |

---

## Open items (priority order)

1. **Update Vercel `DATABASE_URL` + `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` to the new Neon project** if not already.
   Verify with the pre-flight curl below. Without this, device-mint 500s with auth/password errors.
2. **Wire HealthKit reads into Today + Analysis** — replace `Sample.*` static data with
   `HealthKitManager.fetchSum/fetchAverage` calls. Probably an `@Observable HealthDataStore` keyed
   off the range selector.
3. **TestFlight: create App Store Connect record + first archive upload.** `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`
   is now wired (`6A3B3XQF6G` — wcarterbrady@icloud.com). Bundle IDs are
   `com.hbrady.lifeos` and `com.hbrady.lifeos.WidgetExtension` — register both in App Store
   Connect, then `Product → Archive` in Xcode and upload via Organizer.
4. **Day-entry direct-input flows on Today screen** — water/weight/mood/etc. UI that writes to
   `DailyEntry` (SwiftData) and the matching `/api/data/{water,weight,mood}-logs` routes (Neon).
5. **APNs token registration + push** — `UserNotifications` permission,
   `application(_:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:)`, POST to
   `/api/push/register-apns`.
6. **Body + Journal screens** — fully unbuilt.
7. **Revert raw-SQL bypasses to clean Drizzle** — only safe AFTER confirming the new Neon DB
   matches `schema.ts` (which it does, post-`db:push`). Files to revert:
   `src/lib/data/{meals,habits,workouts}.ts`,
   `src/app/api/auth/{device-mint,native-mint,link-identity}/route.ts`,
   `src/lib/auth-server.ts`, `src/lib/user-id.ts`.

## Gotchas accumulated this session

1. **`.swipeActions` only works inside `List`** — every SetRow / MealRow / etc. that lives in a
   `LazyVStack` needs a `.contextMenu` (long-press) or a custom DragGesture instead. `SetRow.swift`
   has the canonical custom-drag implementation; copy that pattern when you need swipe-to-delete
   outside a List.

2. **Drizzle's `.returning()` with no args = `RETURNING *`** which references every schema column —
   if the live DB is missing one, every insert 500s. Use `.returning({id: table.id})` or raw SQL
   when you can't fully trust the live schema. With the new Neon DB this should be fine; the raw-SQL
   bypasses are defensive.

3. **iOS won't unstack two Live Activities for one app.** No API for "render side by side." Best
   you can do is `relevanceScore` to control which floats on top + peek-strip design on the back
   card.

4. **LiveActivityIntent runs in the main app process** — so `UIImpactFeedbackGenerator` and
   `UINotificationFeedbackGenerator` work from inside `perform()`. Fire haptics BEFORE awaiting
   `Activity.update` so the user feels confirmation before the visual lands.

5. **Push two activities in parallel via `async let`** — each `Activity.update` is a ~50-100ms IPC.
   Awaiting serially doubles per-tap latency.

6. **`vercel env pull` defaults to `development` environment** which only has `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN`.
   Use `--environment=production` for the real env vars.

7. **Next.js middleware was bouncing every bearer-bearing /api/* to /signin** until the fix in
   `src/middleware.ts`. If you add new public-ish routes, mind the matcher there.

8. **The Neon `users.id` column type is `text`** in the new DB — `schema.ts` is the source of
   truth. The `externalIdToUuid` hashing is defensive code in case it ever goes back to uuid.

9. **iOS Live Activity height cap** — ~220pt on pre-26 devices, ~260pt on iPhone 17 + iOS 26. The
   current twin-card layout uses ~140pt per card. Don't add more rows.

10. **SwiftData `@Query` only re-runs when the predicate changes** — if you toggle a `@State` flag
    inside a row's button handler expecting the list to refresh, it won't unless you also dirty the
    underlying model. `try? modelContext.save()` after every mutation is the safe path.

## Standard commands

```bash
# Regenerate xcodeproj from project.yml
cd native && xcodegen generate

# Headless sanity build
xcodebuild -project native/LifeOS.xcodeproj -scheme LifeOS \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' \
  -configuration Debug build CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO

# Web build (TypeScript check)
npm run build

# Push to three refs. carter:main is the production deploy.
# Do NOT also push to carter:native — both branches resolve to the
# same Vercel project and you end up with a Production build PLUS a
# queued Preview build for the same SHA, doubling deploy time.
git push origin native && \
  git push life-os-dev native && \
  git push carter native:main

# Database migrations against the new Neon project
npm run db:push          # uses DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED from .env.local

# Pull production env vars from Vercel (after vercel link)
vercel env pull .env.local --environment=production
```

---

## Persistent rules

- Match existing patterns before inventing new ones
- Commit after every major change; never amend unless asked
- Push to three refs (origin/native, life-os-dev/native, carter/native:main) — skip carter/native to avoid duplicate Vercel build
- Run `xcodebuild` sanity-build before committing big changes
- No inline hex — use `LifeOSColor.*` tokens
- Use existing primitives (`Card`, `SectionLabel`, `PillarTile`, `.cascadeReveal`, `.pressable`)
- No emojis in code/commit messages unless asked
- `.swipeActions` doesn't work in `VStack` — use `.contextMenu` or custom `DragGesture`
- Drizzle `.returning()` defaults to `RETURNING *` — explicit column projection or raw SQL
- iOS will stack Live Activities; design for it, can't prevent it
- Never commit `.env*` files

---

## Do NOT do without explicit user authorization

- `git reset --hard` on any pushed branch
- `git push --force` to `main` of any remote (use `--force-with-lease`)
- Delete `ios/` (Capacitor v1 preserved there)
- `--no-verify` on commits
- Rotate `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` on Vercel (logs everyone out)
- Anything that costs money

---

## Pre-flight before issuing your first command

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/life-os-hbrady
git status                          # clean tree
git branch --show-current           # 'native'
git log -3 --format='%h %s'         # tip ≥ dcf339b
git fetch --all                     # see if anything pushed since

cd native && xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -project LifeOS.xcodeproj -scheme LifeOS \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' \
  -configuration Debug build CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO 2>&1 | tail -3
# expect: ** BUILD SUCCEEDED **

cd ..
curl -sX POST https://life-os-carter.vercel.app/api/auth/device-mint \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"deviceId":"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"}' \
  -w '\nHTTP %{http_code}\n' | tail -3
# expect: 200 with {"token":"...","userId":"device:..."}
```

If device-mint returns 500 with `password authentication failed`, Vercel's DATABASE_URL still
points at the old (broken) Neon project — update `DATABASE_URL` + `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` env vars
to the new project and redeploy.

---

Good luck.
